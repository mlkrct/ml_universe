## L<sub>n</sub> norm
Norm is a function which satisfies the following criteria
- f(x)=0 implies x=0
- f(x+y) is less than or equal to f(x)+f(y)
- for all alpha in real numbers f(alpha.x)=alpha.f(x)


#### Example of L norm
- ##### L<sub>2</sub> norm 
    L<sub>2</sub> norm of a vector is the square root of the sum of
    squares of the vector.

### Orthogonal Vectors
Two vectors V<sub>1</sub>,V<sub>2</sub> are said to  be mutually
orthogonal if their dot product is equal to the zero vector 
or

V<sub>1</sub>.V<sub>2</sub><sup>T</sup>=**0**

### Orthonormal Vectors
Orthogonal vectors whose L<sub>2</sub> norm is equal to 1 are called
orthonormal vectors.

**Theorem 1.0:**

A vector space of n dimensions will have at most n orthonormal vectors.


#### Orthogonal Matrix
Orthogonal Matrix is a matrix whose columns are all orthonormal to one
another.

**Cor 1.0.1:** 

If **A** is an Orthogonal Matrix of order nxn **A**<sup>T</sup>**A**=**I**
where **I** is the identity matrix of order n.
